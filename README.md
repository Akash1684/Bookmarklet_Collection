# Bookmarklet_Collection

A bookmarklet is basically a "one-click" tool that performes specific task on the current window of the browser, such as modifying the 
appearance of a web page, querying a search engine with search terms provided by previously selected text.
<br></br>
So here are few of my fun and useful bookmarklets :

* [Font_Changer](https://github.com/Akash1684/Bookmarklet_Collection/blob/master/Font_Changer.htm) : Picks up random font style and change the font of current webpage.
<br></br>
* [Select_Search](https://github.com/Akash1684/Bookmarklet_Collection/blob/master/Select_Search.htm) : Provide single click search of the selected text.
<br></br>
* [Notes](https://github.com/Akash1684/Bookmarklet_Collection/blob/master/Notes.htm) : Save selected text as notes and can be accessed later.


**NOTE:** This repository is under active developement.
