# Bookmarklet_Collection

A bookmarklet is basically a "one-click" tool that performes specific task on the current window of the browser, such as modifying the 
appearance of a web page, querying a search engine with search terms provided by previously selected text.
<br></br>
So here are few of my fun and useful bookmarklets :

* [Font_Changer](https://github.com/Akash1684/Bookmarklet_Collection/blob/master/Font_Changer.htm) : Picks up random font style from the collection and change the font of current webpage.
<br></br>
* [Select_Search](https://github.com/Akash1684/Bookmarklet_Collection/blob/master/Select_Search.htm) : Provide single click google search of the selected text.
<br></br>
* [Notes](https://github.com/Akash1684/Bookmarklet_Collection/blob/master/Notes.htm) : Save selected text as notes in form of a Cookie, which can be accessed later.
<br></br>
* [URL_short](https://github.com/Akash1684/Bookmarklet_Collection/blob/master/URL_short.htm) : Convert current URL to a shorter URL using TinyURL.com.
